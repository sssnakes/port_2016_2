        <p>Hi there. I’m a working designer &amp; developer in Amsterdam, touching my hand on most aspects of the process, from research through to design and production. I also used do illustration work<span class="red">*</span>on the side, which I don’t do as much of any more, but the skills do still come in handy from time to time.</p>

        <p>For the past year, I’ve been teaching myself how to code, mainly web, as a means to better understand the the underlying structures and methodologies of programming, as well as getting to grips with the freelance world to see the business side of things.</p>

        <p>Right before the summer I was also interning under <a href="http://www.jamesbryangraves.com">James</a> of <a href="http://www.hackersanddesigners.com">Hackers and Designers</a>, and later attended their 2016 Summer Academy, which was great fun.</p>

        <p>As of late, I’ve been getting to grips with PHP and the <a href="http://www.getkirby.com">Kirby CMS</a>, learning how to better structure my content (and, if I’m being honest with myself, a sidestep to postpone the inevitable diving into the MySQL world).</p>

        <p>My second attempt an annual milestone micro-site to test my design practices and technical web-skills. Uses an ajax refresher script to load content into sections.</p>

        <p>A portfolio site created for a photographer and copywriter, who often changes her role between the two, so we settled on a design that can allow the user to decide the degree to which they want to view of either.</p>

        <br /><br />
        <p>Micro gag-site created for the Hackers &amp; Designers Summer Academy 2016. The 2016 theme of the event was ‘Immatieral Labour’, so we created a match-two game that ‘rewards’ the player with signup ads. <br /><br />Click the coin once you're through the link.
        <br />Made with Rens and the H&amp;D team.</p>

        <p>A personal diary and travel blog made for a good friend. We wanted something incredibly modular, that Magot could edit herself if need be, so we went with a 'tweaked' version of the <a href="http://www.semplicelabs.com/">Semplice</a> theme for the end result.</p>
